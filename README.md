## How to make your own WSJT-X announcements - No microphone needed!

### Create a directory to do all your creation work. 


### Download: Go to the [Gyan.dev FFmpeg builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (the standard source for Windows).

Select: Download the file labeled ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z (or .zip).

Extract: Unzip the folder.

Locate Binaries: Go into the extracted folder and find the bin folder. You will see three files: ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, and ffprobe.exe.

The "Quick Fix": Copy these three .exe files and paste them directly into the same folder where your Python script (voice_gen.py) is located.
